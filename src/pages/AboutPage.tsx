          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            ElmSeeds was founded in 2018 by a collective of passionate cannabis researchers, 
            botanists, and cultivators united by a shared vision: to create a seed bank that 
            prioritizes genetic preservation, quality, and innovation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            What began as a small collaborative project among colleagues has grown into a 
            respected seed bank with an international reputation for excellence. Throughout 
            our growth, we've maintained our founding principlesâ€”meticulous attention to 
            genetic selection, rigorous testing, and a commitment to the collector community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Today, we offer one of the most diverse collections of premium cannabis seeds for 
            collectors, with varieties spanning the spectrum from rare landraces to cutting-edge 
            hybrid creations. Our team continues to explore, innovate, and preserve cannabis 
            genetics for collectors around the world.
